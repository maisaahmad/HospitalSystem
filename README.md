  Hospital System

   This Java program is a basic Hospital System that allows the user to perform various tasks related to managing patients, doctors, appointments, and hospital departments. The program uses various data structures such as ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, and Tree to store and organize different types of data.

The main method of the program presents a menu to the user with several options, such as adding a patient or doctor, scheduling an appointment, searching for a patient, sorting patients by name, printing all the patient, show last patient added and delete last scheduled appointment. The user can select an option by entering a number, and the program will execute the corresponding functionality.

The Patient, Doctor, and Appointment classes represent the data associated with patients, doctors, and appointments, respectively. The HospitalDepartment class represents the hospital departments and their sub-departments when the user want toscheduled appointment. The Tree and TreeNode classes are used to implement the HospitalDepartment class.

The program uses various Java concepts such as inheritance, overriding, interfaces, collections, and data structures to implement the functionality. The code is well-organized and easy to read, with comments explaining the purpose of each class and method.

Overall, this program is a simple example of how Java can be used to implement a hospital management system. It can be further extended and enhanced to include additional features and functionality.
